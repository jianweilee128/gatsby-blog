> Ice cream (derived from earlier iced cream or cream ice)is
> a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or 
> dessert. It may be made from dairy milk or cream, or soy, 
> cashew, coconut or almond milk, and is flavored with a 
> sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and any spice, 
> such as cocoa or vanilla. Colourings are usually added, in 
> addition to stabilizers. The mixture is stirred to 
> incorporate air spaces and cooled below the freezing point 
> of water to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. 
> The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at 
> very low temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F). It becomes 
> more malleable as its temperature increases.
